With many open data-sets about COVID-19 and data science tools available to us, is the possible to build a data science driven Expert System that would help us to make decisions related to the risks associated with the spread of the pandemic in your community as well as around the globe? This question was this question that drove the design of a new interactive Web App, called iTrack COVID, available from: https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid.

Using the free open source data science software R, the App reads data from Statistics Canada, Johns Hopkins University Global Coronavirus database and University of Toronto Coronavirus database, and finds automatically the areas of highest risk, according to the selected criteria, such as daily speed (new cases a day) and acceleration (change in speed a day), mortality rate, and growth (aka reproduction) rate. 

As opposed to majority of other App and websites that report COVID data averaged over large regions (e.g., over entire province or country), [iTrack COVID App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid) provides results at much finer municipality scale. This can make a large difference for decision makers and residents of those muicipalities, as it is very common that while *in average* the province is improving, there would be one or few muicipalities where the situation is actually deteriorating, and it is thus critical to identify those muicipalities, and this is what [iTrack COVID App](https://itrack.shinyapps.io/covid)  does.


The App includes both local (city level) information for Canada and US, as well as global information for all countries around the globe, is compatible with mobile devices, and provides region specific URL short-cuts.
